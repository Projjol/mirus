{"name":"Mirus","tagline":"Powerful hybrid kernel operating system","body":"Mirus is a new operating system designed on principles created by Plan 9 from Bell Labs.  Mirus is not a fork or clone of Plan 9, but rather an entirely different operating system that extends the functionality of Plan 9.\r\n\r\nMirus is designed primarily for higher-performance machines, such as workstations and gaming rigs, and to be used by those of higher technical knowledge. We also are trying to implement cluster-based computing and advanced load bearing capabilities.\r\n\r\nA key motivation in the creation of Mirus was to bring many of the powerful concepts created in Plan 9 to a more general audience, and to build upon what was started there.\r\n\r\nMirus was designed to be elegant and powerful, allowing for tasks that may seem menial on other systems to become easy and fluid.\r\n\r\n### Core Features\r\n* Inspired by Plan 9\r\n* Fairly POSIX complient\r\n* Dynamic, node based filesystem\r\n* Forward thinking design\r\n* Resilient driver framework\r\n* Fast and lean microkernel\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\nWe do not have bleeding-edge ISO images available currently.  In order to test drive Mirus, you will need to build it from the source - which is a relatively painless task.  You will want to clone and build the git tree from the `master` branch.  Full build instructions are found in the `BUILDING.md` file.\r\n\r\nYou can run the following commands to configure and build the system:\r\n\r\n```\r\ngit clone https://github.com/joshbeitler/mirus.git --recursive\r\ncd mirus\r\ngit submodue init\r\nrake\r\n```\r\n\r\nA build of Mirus with no additional configuration or specified tasks will generate a bootable `mirus.iso` in the `build` directory.  You can burn this to any bootable medium you see fit, or run it in a virtual machine via `rake qemu`. \r\n\r\n### Dependencies\r\nTo build Mirus, you will need to meet the following dependencies.  If you are not sure whether they are installed on your system, `rake` will notify you on build.\r\n\r\n* `clang` >= 3.3\r\n* `ld`\r\n* `grub2`\r\n* `yasm`\r\n* `xorriso` >= 1.2.9\r\n* `rake`\r\n* `colorize`\r\n\r\n### Contributing\r\nIf you'd like to contribute, we would love you to go ahead.  Grab yourself a copy of the source, and get up close and personal with it.  It doesn't bite - trust us!  Make your changes on a separate fork and send a pull request our way.  See the `CONTRIBUTING.md` file for more details.\r\n\r\n### Issue Tracker\r\nIf you run into issues (which we almost guarantee you will), please post them on the [issue tracker](https://github.com/joshbeitler/mirus/issues).  Please tag and describe your issue in detail, and if any error codes are provided please include them.\r\n\r\n### Getting Help\r\nWe are active on Twitter at [@mirusproject](http://twitter.com/mirusproject), as well as the IRC channel `#mirus` on `irc.freenode.net`.  The [wiki](https://github.com/joshbeitler/mirus/wiki) is an excellent place to look if you need a quick reference of Mirus.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
