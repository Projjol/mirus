{"name":"Mirus","tagline":"Powerful hybrid kernel operating system","body":"Mirus is a new operating system with the aim of trying out new and interesting things, in hopes to get the best combination possible. We throw all existing ideas and standards out the window (ie: POSIX, Single UNIX Specification) - and try to see what we can do better.\r\n\r\nMirus is designed primarily for higher-performance machines, such as workstations and gaming rigs, and to be used by those of higher technical knowledge. We also are trying to implement cluster-based computing and advanced load bearing capabilities.\r\n\r\n### Core Features\r\n* Powerful executable format\r\n* Dynamic, node based filesystem\r\n* Homegrown bootloader\r\n* Completely designed for AMD64 architecture\r\n* Forward thinking design\r\n* Resilient driver framework\r\n* Fast and lean microkernel\r\n* Typical OS stuff (gdt, idt, etc.)\r\n\r\nPlease note that not all of these features are implemented yet.\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\nWe do not have bleeding-edge ISO images available currently.  In order to test drive Mirus, you will need to build it from the source - which is a relatively painless task.  You will want to clone and build the git tree from the `master` branch.  Full build instructions are found in the `BUILDING.md` file.\r\n\r\nYou can run the following commands to configure and build the system:\r\n\r\n```\r\nrake configure\r\nrake\r\n```\r\n\r\nA build of Mirus with no additional configuration or specified tasks will generate a bootable `mirus.iso` in the `build` directory.  You can burn this to any bootable medium you see fit, or run it in a virtual machine via `rake qemu`. See the README.md file for more information.\r\n\r\n### Contributing\r\nIf you'd like to contribute, we would love you to go ahead.  Grab yourself a copy of the source, and get up close and personal with it.  It doesn't bite - trust us!  Make your changes on a separate fork and send a pull request our way.  See the `CONTRIBUTING.md` file for more details.\r\n\r\n### Issue Tracker\r\nIf you run into issues (which we almost guarantee you will), please post them on the [issue tracker](https://github.com/joshbeitler/mirus/issues).  Please tag and describe your issue in detail, and if any error codes are provided please include them.\r\n\r\n### Getting Help\r\nWe are active on Twitter at [@mirusproject](http://twitter.com/mirusproject), as well as the IRC channel `#mirus` on `irc.freenode.net`.  The [wiki](https://github.com/joshbeitler/mirus/wiki) is an excellent place to look if you need a quick reference of Mirus.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
