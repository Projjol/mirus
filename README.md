# Woah! What are you doing here!

In case you [didn't get the memo](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!category-topic/mirus-dev/YRQ06WsqrCg) -- we've moved!  Mirus is now hosted on [BitBucket](https://bitbucket.org/joshbeitler/mirus).  Everything else should continue as normal.  Note that this GitHub repo will _not_ be updated anymore!
