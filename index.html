        <p>Mirus is a new operating system designed on principles created by Plan 9 from Bell Labs.  Mirus is not a fork or clone of Plan 9, but rather an entirely different operating system that extends the functionality of Plan 9.</p>

<p>Mirus is designed primarily for higher-performance machines, such as workstations and gaming rigs, and to be used by those of higher technical knowledge. We also are trying to implement cluster-based computing and advanced load bearing capabilities.</p>

<p>A key motivation in the creation of Mirus was to bring many of the powerful concepts created in Plan 9 to a more general audience, and to build upon what was started there.</p>

<p>Mirus was designed to be elegant and powerful, allowing for tasks that may seem menial on other systems to become easy and fluid.</p>

<h3>
<a name="core-features" class="anchor" href="#core-features"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Core Features</h3>

<ul>
<li>Inspired by Plan 9</li>
<li>Fairly POSIX complient</li>
<li>Dynamic, node based filesystem</li>
<li>Forward thinking design</li>
<li>Resilient driver framework</li>
<li>Fast and lean microkernel</li>
</ul><h3>
<a name="testing" class="anchor" href="#testing"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Testing</h3>

<p>We do not have bleeding-edge ISO images available currently.  In order to test drive Mirus, you will need to build it from the source - which is a relatively painless task.  You will want to clone and build the git tree from the <code>master</code> branch.  Full build instructions are found in the <code>BUILDING.md</code> file.</p>

<p>You can run the following commands to configure and build the system:</p>

<pre><code>git clone https://github.com/joshbeitler/mirus.git --recursive
cd mirus
git submodue init
rake
</code></pre>

<p>A build of Mirus with no additional configuration or specified tasks will generate a bootable <code>mirus.iso</code> in the <code>build</code> directory.  You can burn this to any bootable medium you see fit, or run it in a virtual machine via <code>rake qemu</code>. </p>

<h3>
<a name="dependencies" class="anchor" href="#dependencies"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Dependencies</h3>

<p>To build Mirus, you will need to meet the following dependencies.  If you are not sure whether they are installed on your system, <code>rake</code> will notify you on build.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<code>clang</code> &gt;= 3.3</li>
<li><code>ld</code></li>
<li><code>grub2</code></li>
<li><code>yasm</code></li>
<li>
<code>xorriso</code> &gt;= 1.2.9</li>
<li><code>rake</code></li>
<li><code>colorize</code></li>
</ul><h3>
