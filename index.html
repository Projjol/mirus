            <h1>Self-described "operating system"</h1>
            <p>
                Mirus is a new operating system designed on principles created by Plan 9 from Bell Labs. Mirus is not a fork or clone of Plan 9, but rather an entirely different operating system that extends the functionality of Plan 9.
            </p>

            <p>
                Mirus is designed primarily for higher-performance machines, such as workstations and gaming rigs, and to be used by those of higher technical knowledge. We also are trying to implement cluster-based computing and advanced load bearing capabilities.
            </p>

            <p>
                A key motivation in the creation of Mirus was to bring many of the powerful concepts created in Plan 9 to a more general audience, and to build upon what was started there.
            </p>

            <p>
                Mirus was designed to be elegant and powerful, allowing for tasks that may seem menial on other systems to become easy and fluid.

        <h2>Download</h2>
        <p>
            We do not have bleeding-edge ISO images available currently. In order to test drive
            Mirus, you will need to build it from the source - which is a relatively
            painless task. You will want to clone and build the git tree from the
            master branch. Full build instructions are found in the <a href="https://github.com/joshbeitler/mirus/blob/newsrc/BUILDING.md">build instructions</a> file.
        </p>
        <p>
            Grab the source and perform a simple build with the following commands:
            <code>
                git clone https://github.com/joshbeitler/mirus.git mirus
                <br />cd mirus
                <br />git submodule init
                <br />git submodule update
                <br />rake
            </code>
            The resulting ISO image will be contained in the build directory,
            and is bootable. You can run it in your favorite virtual machines, burn
            it to a stick or disk, or run over a network.
